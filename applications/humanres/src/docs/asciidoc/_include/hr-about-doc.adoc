= About this documentation

This guide was written based on the OFBiz trunk in beginning 2019 using the Tomahawk theme.
The information should be useful too, for users of earlier versions and other themes.
The screen shots, included in the documentation, may look different from what you see in your version
but not so much so that you can not understand the big part of the features.

With close to 100 screens, some which link to applications outside of the HR App, it is easy for a new user to get lost.
Knowing the common UI pattern used in HR App, as described here, will help you stay oriented.

In OFBiz, screens are collection of graphical user interface (GUI) elements that provide an intuitive way to interact with applications.

== Menu Hierarchy
In the back office applications, like Accounting, Marketing and Human Resource, menus are the primary method of navigation between GUI screens. +
The Application menu is the top level menu and links to the back office administration applications. +
Each application has an application sub menu that is the top level menu within the application.

=== Applications Menu

[NOTE]
On all this documentation, "HR menu" refer to the "HR Application sub menu".

=== HR Core Object Menu
Typically, but not always, HR Menu items take their name from an important Core Object or <<ENTITY, entity>>.
For example you have Employees, Employments, Employee Positions etc. All important information subjects in human resource departments.

Many of these menu items open a screen, we will call a Main Search Screen.

It has three main elements

<1> A button : link to a screen for creating a new entity
<2> A Search Options screenlet for building a search filter
<3> A search results screenlet that has columns with navigation widgets to open other application areas.

One of these navigation columns (most of time the first) will open a screen we will call a Feature Menu Screen.
It has menu items for displaying / editing the feature entity and it's supporting entities. +

On most of screens, you can see,

<1> which Application
<2> which Core Object
<3> which related entity

== Process, Tutorial, Video
This documentation is oriented Business Process. Each process is described like a tutorial, and each time a new
Core Object, or important notion is mentioned, a link is done to more detailed information.

Each process described is associated with a Scenario User Interface Automated Test, which is run on
https://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org/humanres/control/main[Apache OFBiz Trunk Demo environment] daily, and on a ofbizextra platform to be able to have a video
of all actions with some comments (Explaining, at each stage, what action will be taken).

Video can be download on the jenkins ofbizextra site,
https://jenkins.ofbizextra.org/view/Trunk-Sel./job/02_Ofbiz_trunk_wktr1_SeleniumWebDriver_tests/[Running Selenium Test],
look by job name and starting with hrscenariodoc, test name is the tutorial name.

or visualize at https://video.ploud.fr/video-channels/ofbizextra_tutorial/videos[Apache OFBiz Tutorial channel]

To have time to read comments, you need to slow down the video speed or to pause it, if you read the documentation in conjunction.

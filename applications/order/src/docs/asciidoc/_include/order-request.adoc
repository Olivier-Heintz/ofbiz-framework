== Request Overview

Requests is the place to handle the documentation of RFQs (Requests for Quotation) and other items needing a response.
Documenting the request when it arrives will assure a record of the request associated with a record of the response.

The two main process using requests are order (sales or purchase) and task (workeffort)

== Request management in UI
=== Find Request
Most of Request (header) field are present in find form or in the list

* *Cust Request ID*, This is the number generated by the system which identifies the Customer Request throughout its life.
* *Cust Request Name*, As a number is difficult to remember, the name you give the Customer Request will identify the Request
                      for you.
* *Cust Request Type ID*, useful for classify or select request, available value can be see on the search field
* *Status ID*, Where is this Request in its progress through the system? Has it just been entered? Has it been fulfilled?
               The Status needs to reflect what is happening with the Request itself, +
               available value can be see on the search field.
* *From Party*, Enter the ID of the Party asking the Request or use the search tool to identify the Party ID.
* *Priority*, What level of importance do YOU attach to this Request?
              Some will naturally be more time critical or more business essential than others.
              Use the Priority system to keep these relative matters in perspective.
* *Response Required Date*, Most Requests will be accompanied with a date by which the information MUST be provided.
             Often times, the Request has little value if not submitted by this date. +
             This is the date by which the requestor expects to hear back from you with his information.

In the result list, there is a [reject] button to directly change Request Status to Reject.

=== New Request
Depending on Request type you need, some fields are not necessary, ex: Cust Estimated Milli Seconds, is only useful for
Task request to estimate how long this task will last.

* *Request Category*,  For future use with Categories of Requests (currently no screen exist !)
* *Requesting Party*, Since the entry is to be made from the search tool which only calls up existing parties,
                     if this is from a party not previously corresponding with your company, you will first need
                     to Create the Party in the Party Manager.
* *Request Date*, The date the Request was made by the Requester. +
[NOTE]
This does NOT automatically populate when entered into the system.
This may be the date the original requestor placed on his Request, so you would want to enter that date.
When he calls to enquire, he might ask about his 'Request of May 14th,' for example.

=== View Request
A page which presents the Request information in a layout, suitable for printing or analysis. +
One sub-domain by screenlet, after creation only information screenlet is populate (and status)

On top of all information, the sub-menu give you access to the edit for each sub-domain (and creation).

=== Request Roles
Useful to associated multiple parties with a Request.

For each party give a roles to the demand.

=== Request Items
Useful to associated multiple product with a Request. For each item it's possible to give qty and amount and description.

* *Product ID*, Only one Product ID can be found in a Quote Item. Narrow this one down to the clearly defined
                Product requested by this item within the request.
                Either enter the Product ID or use the popup search tool.
* *Quantity*, How many are being considered by this request.
* *Selected Amount*, The cost for the selected item.
* *Maximum Amount*, This could be the Maximum price the customer is willing to pay, or it could be the maximum units
                    acceptable to get a price break. In the latter case, for example, he might be asking for 20,
                    but he could get an excellent price break at 24.
* *Story*, What is being sought in this Request. Here the customer's 'story' is summarized.
           Include whatever details can help you keep the customer happy.
           If the Salesman promised extra features for the same price, explain that here.

In the Items list, there is a [Add note] for each line to be able to add notes for the Request Item.

=== Request Contents
Useful to associated files sent by the requestor to give more information about the request.
